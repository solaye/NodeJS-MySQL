Introduction

I created an Amazon-like storefront app, called Bamazon, using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

This app takes in orders from customers and deplete from the store's total supplies.

The app first displays a list of all of the available products, their costs, and current stock.

The app asks the following things from the user.

product ID
the amount the user wants to purchase 


It must be ran in the command line.

Type in node bamazonCustomer.js to start the app.

These are the npm packages I used and are needed to run the app

fs package in node
inquirer
mysql
to install these npm packages run the following commands.

npm install prompt
npm install mysql
