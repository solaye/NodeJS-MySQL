Introduction

I created an Amazon-like storefront app, called Bamazon, using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

This app takes in orders from customers and deplete from the store's total supplies.

The app first displays a list of all of the available products, their costs, and current stock.
